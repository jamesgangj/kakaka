# WEB222 Final Project
I have built a portfolio website for my WEB222 Final Project as a second semester student at Seneca College.

### Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript 

The website has been hosted using GitHub pages itself and you can access it [here]() and the walkthrough video is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/).

# Disclaimer
Please don't just blindly copy code without trying to fix the problem yourself, it's completely pointless to flagrantly violate the course's [Academic Integrity] [Academic Integrity](https://www.senecacollege.ca/about/policies/academic-integrity-policy.html) policy of the course.
